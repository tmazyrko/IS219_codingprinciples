**<h1 align="center"> OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) </h1>** 


The 5 SOLID principles of programming are:

>  1 - Single Responsibility Principle
>  
>  2 - Open-Closed Principle
>  
>  3 - Liskov Substitution Principle
>  
>  4 - Interface Segregation Principle
>  
>  5 - Dependency Inversion Principle

**<h2> Single Responsibility Principle </h2>**

This principle is very similar to the UNIX ideology of "Do one thing, and do it well."
